# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

When we think about HTML. We have to think about how a web page is structured, kind of like the human skeleton. Starting from the head and ending at the foot. In this challenge I mostly restructured the HTML for reusable purposes. The elements now follow the page like it should. Additionally, referenacing to any image so they are easy to find within the page.

+ Tasks Completed 

  + Created respository in GitHub.
  + Renamed elements based on their locations and purpose.
  + Added attributes to images to understand location on a HTML page.
  + Fixed any issues I saw within the HTML or CSS for functionality.
  + Created a README and added screenshot of webpage.
  + Created live page on GitHub.
